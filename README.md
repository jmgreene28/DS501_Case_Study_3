Case Study 3: A k-means analysis of Boston Housing dataset for an R Shiny application deployment

Description of the application: Application filters Boston Housing dataset through k-means algorithm for comparative analysis.

Why was this data set selected: Boston Housing dataset was selected for this case study due to its detailed feature set and it extensive use throughout data science literature to benchmark algorithms. The dataset itself is derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass.

What kind of problems can this applciation solve: This application is designed to help data analysts visualize and compartmentalize Boston Housing data by creating clusters of data via k-means alorgitmic sorting. By selecting/de-selecting cluster sets, data analysts can use this application to visualize relative value profiles of Boston Housing stock.
