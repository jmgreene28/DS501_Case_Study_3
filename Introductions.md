Introduction

In this case study you will have to make an R Shiny application.

1. Please select any data set from below links or any other suitable dataset

 (Links to an external site.)https://www.kaggle.com/datasets (Links to an external site.)

 (Links to an external site.)https://www.data.gov (Links to an external site.)
https://datasetsearch.research.google.com (Links to an external site.)
2. Select an algorithm suitable for the above data set (Classification/Regression/Clustering/Other)

3. Explain the mathematical/statistical details of the algorithm

4. Create a Shiny application giving end user options to change parameters and to see how do they effect in results. Please remember data science life cycle lecture and follow the suggestions. Explain your data set and machine learningmodeling methodology in the decsriptive on your shiny application

5. Deploy your application to

https://www.shinyapps.io (Links to an external site.)

Get help on how to deploy your apps http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html (Links to an external site.)

6. What do you need to submit?

Submit link of your R Shiny application from https://www.shinyapps.io (Links to an external site.) on Canvas Course Webpage

    What data you collected?
    Why this topic is interesting or important to you? (Motivation)
    How did you analyze the data?
    What did you find in the data? (please include figures or tables in the report)

7. Check in your code into GitHub https://github.com (Links to an external site.) (including data, take a small dataset, few MB)

Your app should run something like below from RStudio 

shiny::runGitHub("shiny-examples", "rstudio", subdir = "001-hello")

DO NOT email me the code and/or application
